<h2>Fluorish Cores</h2>
<h3>Is your Core Fluorishing?</h3>
<p>Fluorish Cores allows your flow cytometry instrument facility or 'core' to upload the instrument configurations of all the instruments in their facility. &nbsp;These configurations are then available to any Fluorish member who joins that core, through both the website and panel design tool.</p>
<p>Cores can view their user list, message them, and track time requested on the instruments.</p>
<p>If the instrument core facility(ies) at your institution have set up a core account on Fluorish, then these cores are available to join when you sign up for a Fluorish account. &nbsp;The first time you log in, there is a section for "Cores Available to Join" on the HOME page.</p>
<p>Once you join a core, click on the "Instrument" tab in your account to view all of the instruments available through the core facility. When you use the <a href="/design/">panel design tool</a>, simply log into your account upon launching the panel design tool, and then step 2 will allow you to select any of these instruments available from the core facility. &nbsp;Therefore, you can ensure you are designing a panel with fluorophores optimized for the specific instrument you are going to run your specimens through!</p>
